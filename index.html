                <h4>
                    <p>I was born in the Philippines and raised primarily in the beautiful state of
                        Kentucky. My amazing partner, Ashley, & I share our lives with two beautiful children, Elijah &
                        June.
                    </p>
                    <p>We've enjoyed establishing our family's roots in the city of Louisville, and we've come to enjoy
                        its diverse and cosmopolitan aspects. From exploring its insanely good local dining scene to
                        enjoying its pull of solid entertainment options,
                        we've truly come to love this town.
                    <p>Living in Louisville, I've been grateful for easy access to a state filled
                        with seeemingly endless natural beauty. Opportunities to hike and explore, with my family, is
                        truly one of my greatest joys. Our family's ongoing project to visit every waterfall that we can
                        find in Kentucky has been a gift unto itself.
                    </p>
                    <p>Thanks for spending a bit of your time to know a little about me. Feel free to send me a
                        message on my Connect page, if you'd like to know more.
                    </p>

                <h4>
                    <p>I've spent most of my working life in the restaurant industry and customer service.
                        I've worked in all aspects of front-of-house service, and, in most recent years,
                        I've primarily served in a management role. I made the transition into the tech
                        industry, early in 2022, and I'm currently employed in technical support for point-of-sale
                        systems offered by Global Payments in
                        Jeffersonville, Indiana.
                    </p>
                    <p>I'm excited to bring a strong foundation in customer service and effective team-based dynamics
                        into a technologically-driven environment. I'm passionate about the
                        tech industry and look forward to continuing to hone and broaden my
                        skills.
