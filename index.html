                        <p>
                            I was born in the Philippines and raised primarily in the beautiful state of
                            Kentucky. My amazing partner, Ashley, & I share our lives with two beautiful children,
                            Elijah & June.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We've enjoyed establishing our family's roots in the city of Louisville, and we've come to
                            enjoy its diverse and cosmopolitan aspects. From exploring its insanely good local dining
                            scene to enjoying its solid pull of entertainment options, we've truly come to love this
                            town.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Living in Louisville, I've been grateful for easy access to a state filled
                            with seeemingly endless natural beauty. The opportunity to hike and explore, with my family,
                            is truly one of my greatest joys. Our family's ongoing project to visit every waterfall
                            that we can find in Kentucky has been a gift unto itself.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With a technical aptitude and affinity for math & science, I began my college studies in
                            Engineering at Purdue University. However, as a creative soul, with a lifelong
                            love of drawing & illustration, I pursued my passion into the art program at the University
                            of Kentucky and later at the University of Louisville, where I received formal training in
                            Art Studio with a focus in Graphic Design & Illustration. I also minored in Art History to
                            satisfy my interest in providing context to artistic styles & aesthetic sensibilities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I initially worked in the hospitality industry as a means of support, but it soon developed
                            into a career. Working with food satisfied my creative urges as well as being a
                            fulfilling environment for a naturally social person.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although satisfied with achieving my ambitions within the hospitality industry, I felt a
                            calling to my original vocational pursuits. At the end of 2021, I heeded the call by
                            focusing my efforts toward a transition into the tech industry, in hopes of fulfilling my
                            natural talents & technical skills, and establishing myself in a satisfying career in
                            development.

                            My love for the visual arts has always been a constant passion. I've been happy to pursue
                            freelance graphic design & illustration, throughout my working life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the hospitality industry, I've worked in almost every type of restaurant from
                            short-order, in my humble beginnings, to fine dining, where I thrived at the
                            peak of my skills as a captain on the dining room floor. My experience carried me, most
                            recently, into management roles, where I have enjoyed applying my expertise into
                            coordinating staffing & operations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Early in 2022, I made the transition into the tech industry, and I'm currently serving in a
                            technical support role for maintaining point-of-sale systems offered by Global Payments in
                            Jeffersonville, Indiana. I've worked as a manager with many similar systems, and it's a been
                            a particular pleasure to provide assistance to managers, whom aren't able to provide
                            satisfying customer service, due to a technical problem that is out of their hands.
                            Technology should be a solution, not a problem, and it's particularly fulfilling to prove
                            that to be true.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm excited to bring a strong foundation in customer service and effective team-based
                            dynamics into a technologically-driven environment. I'm passionate about utilizing my
                            creative talent in the tech industry and look forward to continuing to hone and broaden my
                            skills.
                        </p>
