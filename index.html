                <h4>
                    <p>I was born in the Philippines and raised primarily in the beautiful state of
                        Kentucky. With the support of my amazing partner, Ashley, I have been blessed with the privilege
                        of raising two beautiful children, Elijah & June, and I enjoy sharing as much of my time as
                        possible with them.
                    </p>
                    <p>Having established roots in the city of Louisville, we take every opportunity to enjoy
                        its cosmopolitan aspects. From exploring its multitudes of local dining & entertainment
                        options, as well as its rich local cultural events, we look forward to constantly seeking new
                        adventures around every corner of this vibrant city.
                    <p>Living in a state full of natural beauty, we also enjoy exploring, camping
                        & hiking, particularly in the Red River Gorge & Daniel Boone National Forest. Our ongoing
                        project to visit every waterfall in Kentucky has gifted us with discovering many of its
                        seemingly endless natural wonders.
                    </p>
                    <p>Thank you for taking a bit of your time to get to know a little about me. Feel free to send me a
                        message
                        on my Connect page, if you'd like to know more!

                <h4>
                    <p>I've spent most of my working life in the restaurant industry and customer service.
                        I've worked in all aspects of front-of-house service, and, in most recent years,
                        I've primarily served in a Management role. I made the transition into the tech
                        industry, early in 2022, and I'm currently employed in direct
                        technical support for point-of-sale products offered by Global Payments, in
                        Jeffersonville, Indiana.
                    </p>
                    <p>I'm excited to bring a strong foundation in customer service and team-based dynamics
                        into a technologically-driven environment. I'm passionate and motivated about the
                        tech industry and look forward to continually honing and broadening my development
                        skills to offer myself as a valuable asset and team member to any organization.
                    </p>
