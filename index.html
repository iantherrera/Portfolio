                                My love for the visual arts has always been a constant passion. I've been happy to

                                In the hospitality industry, I've worked in almost every type of restaurant from
                                short-order, in my humble beginnings, to fine dining, where I thrived at the
                                peak of my skills as a captain on the dining room floor. My experience carried me, most
                                recently, into management roles, where I have enjoyed applying my expertise into
                                coordinating staffing & operations.

                                Early in 2022, I made the transition into the tech industry, and I'm currently serving
                                in a
                                technical support role for maintaining point-of-sale systems offered by Global Payments
                                in
                                Jeffersonville, Indiana. I've worked as a manager with many similar systems, and it's a
                                been
                                a particular pleasure to provide assistance to managers, whom aren't able to provide
                                satisfying customer service, due to a technical problem that is out of their hands.
                                Technology should be a solution, not a problem, and it's particularly fulfilling to
                                prove
                                that to be true.
