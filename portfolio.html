                            Driven & highly motivated, with a love of <strong>problem-solving</strong> and an insatiable
                            curiosity about how things work, I have been able to debug my way into proficiencies in
                            several coding languages.<br>
                            I am a <strong>disciplined fast learner</strong>, and I enjoy the challenge and research
                            required to tackle one small problem at a time.
                        </p>

                            At the end of 2021, I began participation in the CS50x course, offered by Harvard
                            University.<br>
                            Thus far, CS50x has provided me with an understanding of fundamentals in
                            computer science, as well as coding proficiency in <strong>C & Python</strong>, and a
                            familiarity with <strong>SQL</strong>.<br>
                            This program has been instrumental in instilling & developing the <strong>critical
                                thinking</strong> and <strong>self-driven research skills</strong> that are required for
                            success in coding and remaining current in a field that is constantly changing.

                            In the spring of 2022, I began participation in the CODE Louisville program on a Front End
                            Web Development track.<br>
                            CODE Louisville is a fantastic program seeking to strengthen our
                            local tech community & industry by offering training, education & mentorship to motivated
                            local residents, all at no cost to its students.<br>
                            This program is currently facilitating the development of my skills in <strong>HTML, CSS &
                                Javascript</strong>, and I'm looking forward to future
                            training in frameworks & backend functionality which will build on my currently growing
                            skills.<br>
                            I am truly grateful to the program & its mentors for helping me develop this website
                            as my Capstone Project!
