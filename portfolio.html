                <h4>
                    <p>Driven & highly motivated, with a love of problem-solving and an insatiable curiosity about how
                        things work, I have been able to debug my way into proficiencies in several coding languages.
                        I am a disciplined fast learner, and I enjoy the challenge and research required to tackle one
                        small problem at a time.

                    </p>
                    <p> At the end of 2021, I began participation in the demanding CS50x
                        course that is offered by Harvard University. Thus far, CS50x has provided me with an
                        understanding of fundamentals in computer science, as well as coding proficiency in C &
                        Python, and a familiarity with
                        SQL. This program has been instrumental in instilling & developing the critical thinking mindset
                        and self-driven research skills that are required for success in programming and remaining
                        current in a field that is constantly changing.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the spring of 2022, I began participation in the CODE Louisville program on a Front End Web
                        Development track. CODE
                        Louisville is a fantastic program seeking to strengthen our local tech community & industry by
                        offering training, education & mentorship to motivated local residents, all at no cost to its
                        students. This program is currently facilitating the development of my skills in HTML, CSS &
                        Javascript, and I'm looking forward to future training in frameworks & backend functionality
                        which will build on my currently growing skills. I am truly grateful to the program & its
                        mentors for
                        helping me
                        develop this website as my Capstone Project!
                    </p>
                    <p>As a creative person with a background in Graphic Design & Illustration, I enjoy proficiency in
                        numerous
                        visual design applications, but my familiarity is primarily in applications featured by
                        Adobe's Creative Suite. As I pivot my creativity towards coding, I bring an experienced design
                        sensibility,
                        with a particular emphasis on strong layout & UX design, and the capability of merging
                        pleasurable aesthetics with a
                        clear
                        communication of content.
                    </p>
                    <p>Having worked extensively in customer service and with facilitating team-based work, I truly
                        enjoy creating adaptive & enjoyable user-oriented experiences in fast-paced, rapidly changing,
                        team-based environments.
                    </p>
                    <p>My GitHub will continue to expand with content as I create new projects, so please do come back
                        to see what's new!
                    </p>
