                <h4>
                    <p>Driven & highly motivated, with a love of problem-solving and all things technology-related, I
                        have been able to gain proficiency in several coding languages over a relatively short period
                        of time.
                    </p>
                    <p>I am a disciplined fast learner, and I have used it recently to my advantage to take on the
                        challenges
                        provided by the wonderful CS50x
                        course, offered by Harvard University. Thus far, CS50x has provided me with an
                        understanding of many fundamentals in computer science, as well as coding proficiency in C,
                        Python &
                        SQL. This program has been instrumental in instilling & developing the critical thinking mindset
                        and self-driven research skills that are required for success in programming and remaining
                        up-to-date in a field that is constantly changing.
                    </p>
                    <p>I am currently completing the CODE Louisville program on a Front End Web Development track. CODE
                        Louisville is a fantastic program seeking to strengthen our local tech community & industry by
                        offering training, education & mentorship to motivated local residents, all at no cost to its
                        students. This program is currently facilitating the development of my skills in HTML, CSS &
                        Javascript, and I'm looking forward to future training in frameworks & backend functionality
                        which will build on my currently growing skills. I am truly grateful to the program for
                        helping me
                        develop this website as my Capstone Project!
                    </p>
                    <p>As a creative person with a background in Graphic Design & Illustration, I have acquired
                        proficiency in
                        many visual design applications, with familiarity primarily in applications featured by
                        Adobe's Creative Suite. Pivoting my creativity towards coding, I bring an experienced design
                        sensibility,
                        with a particular emphasis on strong layout & UX design, and the capability of merging
                        pleasurable aesthetics with a
                        clear
                        communication of content.
                    </p>
                    <p>With extensive experience in customer service and facilitating team-based work, I enjoy creating
                        adaptive & enjoyable user-oriented experiences in fast-paced, rapidly changing, team-based
                        environments.
                    </p>
                    <p>Please check back on my Github, as I continue to create more projects exploring technologies,
                        while progressively refining my skills.
                    </p>
